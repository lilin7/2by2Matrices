Matrix2x2.cpp:
Class using methods and overloaded operators to implement the Mat2x2 ADT described in assignment 3;
Overloaded input operator for reading user input Mat2x2 values;
Overloaded output operator for writing Mat2x2 values.


Driver class:
Driver program to test the Matrix2x2 class implemented above.
